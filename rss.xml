            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Techies Project by Photographer Helena Price</h1><p>The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
